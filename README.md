# Crystals Collector, a Game

This is a little game I wrote using JavaScript in order to complete an assignment for the UT Austin Coding Boot Camp certificate program. 

## Game Play

You play the game by clicking on the jewels, which are all assigned random number values from 1-12. You play the game by trying to match the totaled jewel-click values with the random number shown at the top.
